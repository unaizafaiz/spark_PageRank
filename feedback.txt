Hi Unaiza:
It is pleasure to grade your homework, as usual. It is superbly done, and small comments are to make sure that you use proper annotations/markup in your README, and it is poorly readable now.

Also, it would help if you explain your design, the choice of transformation in your document. I suggest that you do that for your prospective employers.

You earned the full grade, 5% + 3% bonus. Congratulations!

Thank you,
Mark
